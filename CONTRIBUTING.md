Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to Concrete, you can do so through GitHub 
by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure your code compiles, conforms to
the code style, and the tests still pass by running `./gradlew clean build
checkstyle connectedCheck test`.
